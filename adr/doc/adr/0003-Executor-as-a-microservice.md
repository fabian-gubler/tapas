# 3. Executor as a microservice

Date: 2022-10-03

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The roster can select and prompt an executor to carry out a task. After the executor gets the task, he performs the task and returns the result. We donâ€™t expect executors need their own data storage.


## Decision

We decide to use a microservice architecture for executors.

## Consequences

If an executor fails, the rest of the system and other executors will still work as it runs separately. Executors are easy to deploy and easy to test.
