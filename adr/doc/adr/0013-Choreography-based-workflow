Date: 2022-10-21

## Status
Accepted

## Context
To manage communication either a central orchestrated workflow or a distribute choreographic workflow can be implemented.

## Decision

To manage our Workflow we choose and choreography based approach.
This helps us achieve a high decoupling of the services and improves scalability and fault tolerance.

## Consequences

Workflow based choreography needs to be managed in a distributed workflow.
